## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd research_assistant
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. **Access the application:**
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **DocumentProcessor**: Handles PDF/TXT file processing, text extraction, and context finding
2. **AIAssistant**: Manages AI interactions, question generation, and answer evaluation
3. **Streamlit App**: Provides the web interface and user interaction flow

### Data Flow

1. User uploads document → DocumentProcessor extracts and structures text
2. AI generates summary and stores document in memory
3. User selects interaction mode:
   - **Ask Anything**: Query → Context retrieval → AI answer with justification
   - **Challenge Me**: AI generates questions → User answers → AI evaluation with feedback

### Key Features Implementation

- **Contextual Understanding**: Uses sentence similarity and keyword matching to find relevant document sections
- **Justification**: Every answer includes specific document references
- **Challenge Generation**: AI creates comprehension-focused questions with expected answers
- **Answer Evaluation**: Compares user responses against expected answers with detailed feedback

## Usage

1. **Upload Document**: Click "Choose a PDF or TXT file" and select your document
2. **Process**: Click "Process Document" to analyze the content
3. **Review Summary**: Read the auto-generated summary
4. **Choose Mode**:
   - **Ask Anything**: Enter questions and get contextual answers
   - **Challenge Me**: Answer AI-generated questions and receive feedback

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Python with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2 for PDF extraction, NLTK for text processing
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for summarization, QA, and evaluation
- **Context Management**: Intelligent text segmentation and relevance scoring

## Evaluation Criteria Alignment

- **Response Quality**: Document-grounded answers with clear justifications
- **Reasoning Mode**: Logic-based question generation and evaluation
- **UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface
- **Code Structure**: Modular design with clear documentation
- **Creativity**: Context highlighting and memory handling
- **Minimal Hallucination**: All responses anchored to document content
```
